I started by going to Foundation and looking what templete would be good to use. Once i Figured out what i needed.I started to build 
the layout. I was able to come up a layout that my taem was able to use for the project.
I added My Top Jumbotn and set that with a background image so it would nice. I then added a input for the search to be done

After this a looked for a table to use for the results given by the search. I was able to Divid teh table by using display: flex;
NOw that all the layout was set. the API that we were going ti use did not have acceee to the sheilds for each team. I took it Upon myself to find away.
I was able to get access to the API needed. With that I was able to make the team call to the each City or county the taem is located as well as the Icon
To see hoe the weather is like during that time.

I was able to use this to my advantage. With the input the is given I used that to be able to also call the Current Wearther of teh City or counrty
